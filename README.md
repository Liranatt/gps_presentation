# Liran Attar Portfolio Structure

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This repository is organized as a multi-project showcase, hosted on GitHub Pages at [liranattar.dev](https://liranattar.dev).

## Structure

```
/                # Root: Main portfolio landing page (index.html)
|-- CNAME        # Custom domain for GitHub Pages
|-- gps/         # Visual GPS Localization project (all original files)
|-- garmin/      # Garmin Health Intelligence project
|-- .git/        # Git repository (do not delete)
```

### Details
- **index.html** (root): My personal landing page, styled with Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons. Features project cards for easy navigation.
- **gps/**: Contains all files and assets for the Visual GPS Localization project (originally the entire repo content).
- **garmin/**: Contains the Garmin Health Intelligence project page, including a live system status badge and launch button.
- **CNAME**: Keeps the custom domain (liranattar.dev) mapped to this site.

## Notes
- All internal links and image paths have been updated to reflect the new structure.
- Do **not** delete or move the `.git` or `CNAME` files from the root.
